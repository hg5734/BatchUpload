We are an online car repair company.
In our DB, we are starting to store the days and working hours for our workshop.
We need 2 APIs:
 A pickup api to list the next 7 days and the working hours for each day.
 A delivery Api that will take the pickup date and time as input parameters and
show the next 7 days after the time required for the workshop to repair the car
(eg. 24hrs)
